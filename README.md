I am Brad Bruno, the original creator and sole owner of AskNova, an AI platform I developed and launched publicly on GitHub over two weeks ago

AskNova was created, developed, and published by me.
The GitHub repository and commit history clearly show the original creation date and development timeline.
All intellectual property, branding, and future development of AskNova are under my ownership and direction.
I welcome collaboration and innovation—but not misrepresentation or plagiarism. I am currently taking the necessary steps to protect my work legally and ensure that proper credit is given where it is due.

If you have any questions or would like to verify the authenticity of AskNova’s origin, feel free to reach out directly.

Thank you to everyone who has supported the project so far. The journey is just beginning.
